### Optimization Algorithm

**Monte Carlo Revenue Optimization:**
```python
# Core algorithm

3. **Aggressive**: 15% max overbooking, 60% confidence interval
4. **Optimal**: AI-driven revenue maximization

**Cost Model:**
- **Denied Boarding**: $1,200 per passenger
- **Volunteer Compensation**: $800 per passenger
